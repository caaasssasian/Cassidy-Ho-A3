I chose Nutella because it's my most favourite spread. I believe I've built a decent looking design with functional links and forms. I've incorporated the colours of the Nutella jar and I think I've distributed the colours well.",

            "travelParagraph": "I've designed this Travel/Photography home page in my 'COMP1051 - Design Principles' class. The objective was to design a home page of your business. We had to incorporate the principles we learned in class to our home page such as balance, emphasis, space, typography, colour modes/schemes, and etc. With the mindset of travelling, I used a gradient of white and blue, the plane in the background creates an implied line towards the 'Contact' link and 'Book Your Appointment' link (which also has a royal blue book for emphasis as the call-to-action).",

            "napoleonParagraph": "In 'COMP1002 - Web and Internet Fundamentals' class, we were suppose to replace the text in a movie poster with only HTML. I chose to do the 'Napoleon Dynamite' movie poster and I believe I did a good job in creating a copy of the movie poster. I've also created a mini website showcasing the description of the movie, the link to the poster and reivews."
